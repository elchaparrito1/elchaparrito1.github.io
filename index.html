            <p>
                Hello. Welcome to my website. I am passionate about putting hard work and dedication into everything that I do. What drives
                me is the challenge of the task. This is evident in the practice that I put into playing and excelling at
                sports in my youth. As I grew older, I accepted new challenges such as volunteering and working for my church,
                and learning new languages, customs, and cultures along the way.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was my love for learning Spanish and Portuguese that led me to study history at the University of Utah. The challenge
                of academia taught me self-determination, and how to look at the bigger picture; how to problem solve, and
                think critically.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a man of many passions who believes in refining one's craft. Whether its learning how to become a better father and
                husband, preparing the best dish of Mexican mole, or discovering what techniques work best for training my
                horses, I'm always up to the challenge.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is what excites me about the challenge of learning to code and become a computer programmer. It will test all my skills,
                and push me to new limits, and opportunities that I hope to attain in life through hard work and determination.
            </p>
